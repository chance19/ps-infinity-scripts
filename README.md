# Powershell Scripts for Infinity API

*Infinity.co - Call Tracking Software*

This repo will contain some of the scripts I have written to interact with the Infinity API.

The company I work/worked for use Infinity.co for tracking marketing campaigns. I found that there were some limitations to their Admin Console but their API is very good.

>For example in their admin console you cannot export a full list of all the fixed numbers you have provisioned against all of your dial in groups. The FixedNumberReport.ps1 script in this repo will do this for you and export to csv.

More scripts to follow...
